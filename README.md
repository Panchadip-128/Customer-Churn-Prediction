Telco Customer Churn Analysis
------------------------------

Overview
This project involves the analysis of Telco customer churn data. The goal is to explore various factors contributing to customer churn and derive actionable insights to reduce churn rate.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains information about Telco customers including demographic data, services subscribed, and churn status.

Analysis Steps:
-----------------
1) Data Exploration:

Checked data shape, columns, and data types.
Examined descriptive statistics of numeric variables.
Visualized the count of churned vs. non-churned customers.

2) Data Cleaning:

Checked for missing values and removed them.
Converted the "TotalCharges" column to numeric type.
Handled missing values in the "TotalCharges" column.
Created bins for customers based on tenure.

3) Data Analysis:

Explored the distribution of individual predictors by churn.
Converted the target variable "Churn" to a binary numeric variable.
Converted categorical variables into dummy variables.
Explored the relationship between Monthly Charges and Total Charges.
Built a correlation of all predictors with "Churn" and visualized it using a bar plot and heatmap.
Bivariate Analysis:

Explored the distribution of different variables for churned and non-churned customers.

4) Machine Learning Model Training:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Selected appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, etc.).
Trained the models on the training data.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tuned hyperparameters to improve model performance if necessary.


Conclusion:
-----------

Derived insights such as the impact of payment methods, contract types, online security, tech support, and customer demographics on churn.

Results
--------
The analysis reveals several insights into factors contributing to customer churn, such as contract types, payment methods, availability of services, and customer demographics.

Future Steps:
------------
Future steps may include:

Further analysis to explore additional factors impacting churn.
Developing predictive models to forecast customer churn.
Implementing targeted strategies to reduce churn based on the insights gained
